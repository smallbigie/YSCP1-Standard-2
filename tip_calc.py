def tip_calculator():

    #Ask for Bill Amount    #bill_amount
    "Please enter your Bill Amount: "


    #Validate
    If Bill Amount <0                   <-- Needs fixing later
        PRINT "Invalid ..."             <-- Needs fixing later


    #Ask for Tip Amount     #tip_amount
    PRINT "Please enter the amount you would like to tip (e.g. 10, 15, 20, 25): "


    #Validate Tip Amount
    If Tip Amount (is not percentage)   <-- Needs fixing later


    #Calculate the Amounts
    bill_amount * tip_percentage = tip_amount
    total_bill = bill_amount + tip_amount


    #Display Results
    print bill_amount: (e.g., two decimal places and a dollar sign)
    print tip_amount: (e.g., two decimal places and a dollar sign)
    print total_bill: (e.g., two decimal places and a dollar sign)
